## Leetcode Helper

Leena Vieltojarvi

### What and why?

This semester, I am looking to build a web platform that is able to help with studying leetcode problems. I personally have had difficulty with being able to both keep a schedule for working on leetcode problems as well as had difficulty with remembering specific techniques that should be used for certain problems. I assume others may also be having this problem, so this software would aim to help people like me with building a schedule to practice leetcode as well as to learn techniques for effectively solving leetcode problems.

### For whom?

The end users of this software would be people seeking to polish their leetcode skills, which would generally include people looking to work in or currently working in software engineering. Myself as well as many of the students in this class would likely be people who could be end users of this software considering many of us are currently looking for jobs and internships which require leetcode exams. 

### How?

Users would be able to either make a calendar that is populated by leetcode questions to help them study or would be able to select a particular topic and would be guided through a lesson that goes over common techniques for solving problems within this topic area, then would be given a list of problems within the selected topic area ranging from easy to hard. When it comes to generating the calendar, the user would input what days of the week they aim to study and how much time they plan to study on each day as well as which topics they want to cover and what range of time they aim to be studying for (EX: 3 weeks, 2 months, etc). The program would then create a study plan for the user using the inputted guidelines with a combination of leetcode questions and guided lessons covering the topics the user selected. 

### Scope

The most technically difficult part would likely be calendar generation, which I think should be very doable for a group of 4-6 programmers. Though I think the most challenging part might be populating/creating the lessons for each topic area, but this can be scoped around how many topic areas we aim to support so even though I think researching and figuring out how to present each topic in an engaging and helpful way may be challenging, we can choose to support only a small number of topics if needed.
